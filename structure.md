# AI Agents: Structure and Concepts

AI agents are autonomous entities that perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals. They are designed to act intelligently, often by employing a cycle of perception, reasoning, planning, and action.

## Core Components of an AI Agent:

1.  **Perception:** Agents gather information from their environment (e.g., via sensors, input files, user commands).
2.  **State Representation:** They maintain an internal model of their current understanding of the environment and their own goals.
3.  **Reasoning/Planning:** Agents process perceived information, update their state, and formulate a plan of action to achieve their objectives.
4.  **Action:** They execute the planned actions, which can involve interacting with the environment, generating code, writing files, or communicating with users.

## How they relate to this project:

This project embodies the AI agent paradigm by integrating these core components across various modules:
- **`agent/core.py`**: This module is central, defining the foundational structure and execution flow for an agent's operations. It includes mechanisms for state management (`AgentState`) and orchestrates the agent's `Reasoning/Planning` and `Action` through functions like `execute_goal` and `_plan_execution`.
- **`context_manager.py`**: Supports the agent's `Perception` and `State Representation` by providing the environment, historical context, and rules the agent uses to reason and act effectively.
- **`file_ops` (e.g., `reader.py`, `writer.py`)**: These modules enable the agent's `Perception` (reading file content and project structure) and `Action` (writing files, showing diffs), allowing it to interact directly with the project's codebase.
- **`llm/providers.py`**: This module provides the core `Reasoning/Planning` capability, as the agent leverages large language models for intelligent decision-making, understanding, and generating plans and code.
