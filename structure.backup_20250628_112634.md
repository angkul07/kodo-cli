# AI Agents: Structure and Concepts

AI agents are autonomous entities that perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals. They are designed to act intelligently, often by employing a cycle of perception, reasoning, planning, and action.

## Core Components of an AI Agent:

1.  **Perception:** Agents gather information from their environment (e.g., via sensors, input files, user commands).
2.  **State Representation:** They maintain an internal model of their current understanding of the environment and their own goals.
3.  **Reasoning/Planning:** Agents process perceived information, update their state, and formulate a plan of action to achieve their objectives.
4.  **Action:** They execute the planned actions, which can involve interacting with the environment, generating code, writing files, or communicating with users.

## How they relate to this project:

This project incorporates the concept of AI agents through modules like `agent/core.py`, which likely defines the foundational structure and execution flow for an agent's operations, including state management and goal execution. The `context_manager.py` further supports this by providing the environment and historical context an agent needs to reason and act effectively.
